# covid19-synthetic-control

In this repository, we replicate the findings of a previous paper using GSCM to estimate the treatment effect of adopting social distancing measures in the grwoth rate of covid-19 cases in the US. We extend the paper by estimating individual treatment effects as well as conducting placebo tests both in space and in time.
